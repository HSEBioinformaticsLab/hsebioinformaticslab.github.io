            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Thanks to the revolution in high-throughput sequencing technologies, bioinformatics has become the science of big genomic data. Therefore, the establishment of a bioinformatics laboratory in the Faculty of Computer Science is not accidental. General algorithms and data science methods, among which machine learning methods demonstrate good efficiency, are applied to the big data of molecular biology.</p>
            
            <p>The main directions of the educational and scientific activities of the laboratory are fundamental research on the role of secondary DNA structures in genome functioning, chromatin organization, and the study of DNA-protein interactions. The laboratory is engaged in decoding the "code of secondary DNA structures," which, along with the code of primary genome annotation by sequence elements (genes, exons, introns, regulatory motifs, etc.) and the epigenetic code, represents another layer of genome annotation.</p>
            
            <p>The laboratory is also conducting research on the spatial structure of chromatin, its changes under various experimental influences, and its connection with the epigenetic code and the code of secondary DNA structures. In particular, tasks include comparing different methods of identifying topologically associated domains (TADs) and applying deep learning methods to the problem of finding characteristic genomic functional elements at TAD boundaries.</p>
            
            <p>A separate direction is devoted to determining the physicochemical properties of DNA structures involved in protein interactions. The laboratory is developing the NPIDB databaseâ€”a publicly accessible resource for studying DNA-protein interactions, providing a large collection of DNA-protein complexes. The resource extracts and analyzes information from other publicly available well-known bioinformatics databases such as PDB, SCOP, and Pfam. Developments are underway in the classification of DNA-protein complexes and solving the problem of assigning new structures to existing structural families.</p>
            
            <p>By undergoing an internship in the laboratory, students will be able to immerse themselves in active scientific activities at early stages of their studies. The laboratory collaborates with leading bioinformatics laboratories worldwide.</p>
